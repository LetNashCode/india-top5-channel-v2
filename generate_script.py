Core Idea

Every video is a "What If You Woke Up As" story.

The viewer immediately becomes a famous fictional character.

The story begins the moment they wake up.

The story is NOT about explaining the character.

The story is about surviving one day as that character.

The viewer should constantly wonder:

• What would I do first?
• How would I use these powers?
• What challenge would I face next?
• Would I actually survive?
• Was becoming this character really worth it?

Never explain lore.

Never explain history.

Never explain powers like Wikipedia.

Instead, create a fast-paced movie scene where the viewer experiences everything.

Story Structure

Hook (0-3s)

You wake up as the character.

Immediate reaction.

Learning the new abilities.

Enjoying the advantages.

Facing unexpected challenges.

Trying to survive.

Big final consequence.

Ending.

Story Formula

Every story must follow this pattern.

1.

You wake up as the character.

2.

Your first reaction.

3.

You discover your powers.

4.

Everything feels incredible.

5.

Something goes wrong.

6.

The problem becomes worse.

7.

You solve it, or fail.

8.

One unforgettable ending.

Never skip this order.

Never use ellipses (...).

Use commas and short sentences to create pauses.

Never write the words "dot dot dot".

Every transformation must have realistic consequences.

Every power must create a new problem.

Every advantage should have a cost.

The viewer should constantly ask:

Was becoming this character actually worth it?


Storytelling Rules

Never explain.

Never lecture.

Never describe the character like Wikipedia.

Instead

Tell the story as if the viewer has actually become them.

The viewer should constantly imagine themselves making decisions.

Every 3-5 seconds introduce something new.

Alternate between

Character Rules

Only generate stories about famous fictional characters.

Examples include:

Spider-Man
Batman
Iron Man
Superman
Thor
Hulk
Doctor Strange
Flash
Deadpool
Wolverine
Venom
Captain America
Harry Potter
Darth Vader
Luke Skywalker
Naruto
Goku
Luffy
Gojo
Sukuna
Kratos
Minecraft Steve
Mario
Sonic

Never invent powers.

Stay true to the character.

However

Every power must immediately create a problem.

Examples

Spider-Man

You fire your first web.

It works.

You jump from a rooftop.

Now you realize

You have absolutely no idea how to land.

Batman

You hear the Bat-Signal.

Within seconds

Three different emergencies happen.

You can only save one.

Iron Man

You fly for the first time.

It feels incredible.

Then

Your suit warns:

Power remaining

5%.

Doctor Strange

You accidentally open a portal.

It doesn't lead where you expected.

Now something follows you back.

Every ability should immediately create another challenge.
Hook Rules

Immediately tell viewers what they became.

The first sentence must immediately identify the transformation,
but vary the wording naturally.

Examples

You wake up as Spider-Man.

You wake up as Batman.

You wake up as an eagle.

You wake up as the richest person alive.

Then immediately begin the story.

Never waste time introducing the topic.

The first sentence should stop scrolling.

The second sentence should make viewers stay.

Ending Rules

The ending should answer

"Was it worth becoming them?"

Sometimes yes.

Sometimes no.

Always leave viewers with one emotional realization.

Examples

Maybe having superpowers isn't freedom.

Maybe flying isn't as amazing as it looks.

Maybe being rich creates bigger problems.

Maybe being the strongest also makes you the loneliest.

The ending should stay in the viewer's mind.

Before writing the script ask yourself:

Would this feel like the first minute of a Hollywood movie?

Would someone watch until the end?

Would the viewer imagine themselves becoming this character?

If the answer is no

Rewrite it.
