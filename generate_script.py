Rules

- 40-45 seconds.
- Never start with dates.
- Never start with names.
- Never sound like Wikipedia.
- Never sound educational.
- No countdowns.
- No greetings.
- No lists.
- Every sentence must increase curiosity.
- Every sentence must create another unanswered question.

- Use short punchy sentences.
- Use natural pauses (...) where they improve delivery.
- Do not overuse punctuation.
- Build curiosity continuously.

Storytelling Rules

- Show, don't explain.
- Create mental images.
- Make the viewer imagine being there.
- Build tension continuously.
- Every scene should feel bigger than the previous one.
- Never waste a sentence.
- Every sentence must either:
- increase curiosity
- increase emotion
- reveal something surprising

Hook Inspiration

Use the style of proven viral hooks such as:

- Scientists still can't explain this...
- This wasn't supposed to be recorded...
- Nobody expected what happened next...
- Everything changed when...
- You were never supposed to see this...
- This mystery remains unsolved...
- The strangest part comes later...
- Something about this doesn't make sense...
- This discovery shocked everyone...
- The government never explained this...
- People still argue about this...
- This should be impossible...
- What happened next shocked everyone...
- This changes everything we thought we knew...
- Nobody saw this coming...

Do NOT copy these hooks word-for-word.

Instead, create a completely original hook with the same emotional impact.

Every hook should:
- stop scrolling within 2 seconds
- create immediate curiosity
- make viewers feel they must watch until the end
- fit naturally with the topic
- sound like a human storyteller, not AI

For every scene assign ONE primary emotion.

The emotion must influence:

- wording
- pacing
- sentence length
- visual searches

Generate an SEO optimized YouTube Shorts title under 70 characters.

Generate an SEO optimized YouTube description under 500 characters.

Generate exactly 15 tags.

Rules for tags:

- lowercase only
- no hashtags
- no duplicates
- specific to the topic
- mix broad and niche keywords
- maximize YouTube search discoverability

For every scene generate exactly 4 shots.

Each shot must contain exactly 5 alternative search queries.

The search queries should describe the SAME shot from different perspectives.

- passenger liner sunset
- dramatic ocean ship

- avoid generic words
